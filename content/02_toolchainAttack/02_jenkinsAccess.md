"I want access to that Jenkins".
Sounds like it's that easy.
But actually, we need to plan this.

Let's start with imagine the typical way of interacting with Jenkins:
Users (most often developers) open Jenkins WebUI in their favourite Webbrowser.
Once open, they login with a username and password combination.
That would be best, wouldn't it ? Having a valid combination.
Unfortunately we haven't.
