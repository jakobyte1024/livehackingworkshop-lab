Many projects and companies utilize Jenkins for years.
There are very well maintained instances - but for a guess you'd expect most Jenkins' as default configuration setups.
That's what we'll try to cover in this chapter.

# Ideation

"I want access to that Jenkins".
Sounds like it's that easy.
But actually, we need to plan this.

Let's start with imagining the typical way of interacting with Jenkins:
Users (most often developers) open Jenkins WebUI in their favourite Webbrowser.

Once opened, they login with a username and password combination.
That would be the best, wouldn't it ? Having a valid combination.
Unfortunately we don't.
