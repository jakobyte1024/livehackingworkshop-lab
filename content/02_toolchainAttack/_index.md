# Toolchain Attack

A toolchain often comes up with various technologies with the aim to support software development projects.
Very often, these technologies are open source software.

With the concept of [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD), those technologies can be understood as "bridge" between development teams and end user.
In other words: "bridge" between a development environment and production environment. Production environment - that's where our data of interest lives.
That's why toolchain technologies are an interesting target for us.

There are numerous CI/CD technologies available.
In the picture below, you'll find some popular technologies.
As an attacker, imagine you could be part of the horizontal flow.
You'd have access to the code and even to the cloud envioronment.

Let's think about possible attack technologies to scan for more enumeration.
