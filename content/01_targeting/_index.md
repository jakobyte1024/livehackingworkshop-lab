# Targeting

We expect valuable information at Nevervictimconsult.
As of now, we don't know much about the company nor about their systems.
Based on their blog, we only know, that they may have transformed something to a public cloud.

What we need to find out is: on which systems can we target.
First of all, we must identify potential systems.

A good starting point is to scan their domain.
There's a fair chance, that DNS structure will provide information for us.
